you can't add a .p12 cert into your keychain if you dont have the password. but you can try to brute force it with [crackpkcs12](https://github.com/crackpkcs12/crackpkcs12)
you'll need to compile it as instructed, then download a dictionary like [this](https://crackstation.net/crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm).

```
$ crackpkcs12 -b -d crackstation-human-only.txt -v Certificates.p12
