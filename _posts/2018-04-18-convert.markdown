Sometimes these subtitle files you find online have some funny utf-16le encoding and your video player doesn't know how to interpret it and just displays gibberish. This script will detect the encoding used, then convert the file to utf-8 which presumably most video players should be able to handle. This is my third python script but I think it's pretty useful, just starting to learn the language and also didn't want to keep uploading to the srt converter websites. Enjoy!
