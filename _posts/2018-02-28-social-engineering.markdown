Today I want to talk a little about social engineering and how you can be more persuasive when asking for help. As engineers, we strive to be efficient in all we do. We want to be effective too because agile processes drive towards getting tangible results... it's not about the journey to get there. How skillfully you are able to combine efficiency and effectiveness dictates if you are percieved by your peers as someone who can "get shit done".

Devops are people too and though much of our job will eventually be automated by AI, for now at least, we'll need to take into account human "inefficiencies". What I mean by this is that there's some value in small talk. When you ping a devops to get you access to some server at 10pm, it's always worth spending a moment to recognize that you value their time. Consider the following requests:

Hey qq, can you get me access to server x?

vs

Hi, sorry to bother you after hours, but I have a really important presentation tomorrow and I was hoping to continue working on it at home. However, I didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to log in, can you help? 

I'm not saying that you'll always get your way but that extra sentence makes a huge difference, even if you already have established a great relationship with the person providing support.

Here are some general guidelines when asking for help:

1. Be courteous. Show that you appreciate their time.
2. Be clear and concise. Show that you understand what you are requesting and try to provide as much relevant info as possible.
3. Don't cry wolf. Abusing the good will of your coworkers will only get you so far. Once it becomes understood that your "life or death" situation can actually be taken care of next week, it'll be infinitely harder to convince anyone when a real crisis strikes.
4. Set limits. Sleep is not overrated and different people react differently when they are tired. Why take the chance? Understand that some "quick question" problems do not necessarily correlate to "quick answers" and as such, know when to call it a night.
5. Be proactive. Show that you have at least tried to google your issue. Asking for how to do something for the 10th time only shows your inability to take notes and that you are taking them for granted. Treat devops as a scarce and valuable resource and they'll likely reciprocate.
